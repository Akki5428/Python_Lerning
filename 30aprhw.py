8. Problem Description:
    A group of spammers is troubling Varun by calling on his mobile phone repeatedly. After a while, Varun observed a pattern that the mobile number from which the spammers call him is always lesser than his mobile number when compared on the number line. The mobile number of Varun is 1234880990. Given a mobile number as an input print True if the number belongs to the spammers else False.
    Input Format:
    The input will be a single integer representing a mobile number.
    Output Format:
    The output would be True if the condition holds else False

Doubt : 1. Numerical Derivative
    Problem Description:
    The derivative of a function is a value that tells us how much the output of a mathematical function would change, if we were to make a very, very tiny change in its input. In mathmetical terms, the limit definition of a derivative is defined as: limo Where x and hare both inputs to the h
    function f. You can safely ignore the lim part in the expression.
    Given the values of x and your task is to evaluate the expression for the function f(x) = 3xÂ² + 2 and print the value obtained.
    Input Format:
    The input will contain two numbers.
    The first line will be the x value.
    The second line will be the h value.
    Output Format:
    The output would be a single line float value of the expression in problem description.
    
    Input:

3.	Floors and Ceilings
    Problem Description:
    The floor function floor(x) is defined as the greatest integer less than or equal to the given number.
    For example, floor(7.64)=7.
    Likewise, the ceiling function ceil(x) is defined as the smallest integer greater than or equal to the given number.
    For example, ceil(7.64)=8.
    Given a number x as input, output its floor(x) and ceil(x) values.
    Note: Assume that the input will never be an integer.
    Input Format:
    One line float value
    Output Format:
    Print two integers, first one denoting the floor value and second one the ceiling value of the given number.
    
    Input:
    7.64
    Output:
    7
    8
    Example Explanation:
    The greatest integer that is less than or equal to 7.64 is clearly 7.
    The smallest integer that is greater than or equal to 7.64 is clearly 8.\

8.Are the weights balanced?
    Problem Description:
    A weighing machine has two arms, a left arm, and a right arm. On both sides of the weighting machine we can put in weights and if both of those weights are equal, the arms of the machine will hang equally in the air, with none of them hanging below the other. This is hard to observe visually hence you are asked to write a program that takes in two weight values as input and outputs True if they will leave the machine balanced and False if they will leave the machine unbalanced.
    Input Format:
    The input will contain two lines denoting the weight values on the left and right arms of the machine
    Output Format:
    True if the machine is balanced. False if the machine is unbalanced.
